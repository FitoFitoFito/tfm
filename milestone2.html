                    <p>In this section I want to talk about the User Persona and it's Journey. For this, I have made two totally different users, one that comes from a low-mid class and doesn't have a job, which we'll call Alice (nice to meet you guys!), and the other a class person with a well-stablished-well paid job which doesn't have the time to deal with bad costumer services, and we'll call her Christina (hey!).</p>

                    <p>When I did the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DHHGWFv3DQeW0SI4kME5f5/Persona-Journey-Blueprint?node-id=0%3A1">user's journey</a> and took the interviews that were presented in <a href="./milestone1.html">Milestone 1</a> into consideration, one main issue was coming up constantly, some of the people didn't have the means to download the app and some other didn't like to be switching from one email to another or dealing with the proper solution that had been proposed to find their tickets.</p>
                
                    <!-- Alice -->
                    <h2 class="secondary_section">Alice Boyd</h2>
                    <p>Alice represents a percentage of people that doesn't have a good mobile, or maybe they do, but they just don't know how to handle it. So, when I did <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DHHGWFv3DQeW0SI4kME5f5/Persona-Journey-Blueprint?node-id=0%3A1">Alice's journey</a> I realize that if these people can't get access to their tickets because some application is getting in the way, I started to think what options I have or more accurate what options I could propose to fix or ease the way they obtain their tickets.</p>

                    <h2 class="secondary_section">Christina Miller</h2>
                    <p>In our <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DHHGWFv3DQeW0SI4kME5f5/Persona-Journey-Blueprint?node-id=0%3A1">journey</a>, Christina is that percentage of the people that have a very busy life, that also have a company personal mobile. She needs to deal with two different emails (home and work) and sometimes she forget in which mobile she is when trying to book tickets.</p>

                <h1 class="sec_title">Sitemap</h1>
                <p>There's no much to say about this section, I created a sitemap and I added a few elements inside Profile that weren't there before.</p>
                <p>One of the ideas we found in response to both Alice's and Christine's problem is the following: "Save her tickets on the Fever Website". So, I believe that creating a more develop Profile area is the key to solve this approachment.</p>
                <h2 class="secondary_section">Below, the Sitemap:</h2>
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FiZtMXe4z0TbNTaCCA1dr3G%2FSiteMap%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                
                <h1 class="sec_title">Wireframe</h1>
                <p>When I was creating the Profile section, I realized that I could create a few areas more which I believe are important for the website. Previewsly on the sitemap, we can see under Profile a few elements like; voucher, wishlist, settings, help and of course, log out.</p>
