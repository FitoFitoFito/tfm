                <p>Fever is the Amazon of the events. It is a worldwide event seller with more than 50 cities helding from beautiful concerts to playful games. The aim of this project is the user experience improvement with the "Fever" platform.</p>
                
                <h2 class="secondary_section">Definition of the problem</h2>
                <p>It has been noted that customers are having issues with their purchases, they are unable to find their tickets after buying them on the website. Most of them can't download the app, others just don't know how to manage an/the app and a few don't want even to download the app.</p>

                <h2 class="secondary_section">Objectives</h2>
                <p>Propose and develop a proper solution to ease the confusion and the stress that is created within this percentage of customer that have difficulties to find their tickets.</p>

                <h1 class="sec_title">Interviews</h1>
                <p>For this project 8 people were interviewed with a survey which was sent as a link through email each time the user finished a task. Even though, 50 emails were sent only a fifth responded to the survey.</p>
                <p>Here I present a summering of 3 of the quesiton I believe were the most important ones. For additional information, please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTKH3Bj_KhtJeGtd_rKBnLhh2Q94MaNIlKMvTxb2dYeFilXeFNVy0YuqYSQn19PZfgVvSblR2wRgi-a/pubhtml">survey</a>.</p>
                <div class="questions">
                    <!-- Question 1 -->
                    <div class="question1">
                        <div class="intro_pregunta">
                            <h4 class="numero">1</h4>
                            <span id="linea"></span>
                        </div>
                

                        <p class="title_Explica">As there were different answers I tried to divide them into four categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin green"></span>Good</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin orange"></span>Medium</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin red"></span>Bad</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin grey"></span>Neutral/out of topic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="imagen_Question">
                            <img src="./img/milestone1/firstquestion.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p class="title_Explica">If we take a look to this graphic we can see the following categories and its percentages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin green"></span>Good --> 12.5%</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin orange"></span>Medium --> 37.5%</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin red"></span>Bad --> 25%</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin grey"></span>Neutral/out of topic --> 25%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="title_Explica">As we can see, a 25% percentage isn't that far from the 12.5% of the "good"-category but if we add to this calculation the "medium"-category giving it half of the weight, we will end up with something like this:</p>
                    
                        <p class="title_Explica">Bad + (Medium/2) - Good = Final Rating = 31.25%</p> 
                    
                        <p class="title_Explica">Meaning that almost a third part of the total of people that answer to the survey thought the app wasn't quite good.</p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Question 2 -->
                    <div class="question2">
                        <div class="intro_pregunta">
                            <h4 class="numero">2</h4>
                            <span id="linea"></span>
                        </div>
                

                        <p class="title_Explica">Same as above, I divided this into three categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin red"></span>Yes</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin orange"></span>Yes, but/ No, but/ Sometimes</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin green"></span>No</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="imagen_Question">
                            <img src="./img/milestone1/secondquestion.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p class="title_Explica">Categories and its percentanges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin red"></span>Yes --> 25%</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin orange"></span>Yes, but/ No, but/ Sometimes --> 37.5%</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin green"></span>No --> 37.5%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="title_Explica">If we applied the same formula as before we end up with a 6.25% of that total which really doesn't like to download the app, now that is small percentage which could go higher but not lower as the "Yes, but"-category has the same percentage as the "no"-category,  meaning that even in a small population (number of interviewed) as this one, those two values will vary very little following the population mean (population expected value/ statistical population).</p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Question 3 -->
                    <div class="question3">
                        <div class="intro_pregunta">
                            <h4 class="numero">3</h4>
                            <span id="linea"></span>
                        </div>
                

                        <p class="title_Explica">Again, I divided this into three categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin red"></span>Email account</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin green"></span>Other</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="imagen_Question">
                            <img src="./img/milestone1/thirdquestion.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p class="title_Explica">Categories and its percentanges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin red"></span>Email account --> 66.8%</li>
                            <li class="li_rating"><span class="ratin green"></span>Other --> 33.4%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="title_Explica">In our statistic, we are not taking into account the users that didn't answer this question, but even if we would consider their values (which is 0) the difference between "email account"-category and "other"-category would be the same as the one we are now observing, number (percentage) would be lesser, yes, but in the same range.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="benchmarking">
                    <h1 class="sec_title">Benchmarking</h1>
                    <p>In this section I would like to talk about the competition, for this I have selected 3 competitors; AirBnB which is a worldwide private company that offers an online marketplace platform for hospitaliry services, also it offers different type of experiences there where ever you go, Viagogo, an online platform that sells tickets to events on live, from there you can be the one that sells the ticket or the one that is buying it, and last, Atrapalo, that is a platform for promoting leisure offers, shows, hotels, restaurants, activities, among others.</p>
                    <p>I believe Fever website design isn't that far from the others, although there is a few point I wish to discuss.</p>
                    <p>The navigation bar is good enough but when we want to see what type of events we can chose to go, we end up with a word that doesn't quite describe exacly what I'm looking for, I'm talking about the "Menu". If we compare Fever's way to catalogize their events (under the Menu word) with the competition we can see that maybe if we could use "Type of activities", "Type of events" or even "Categiries" would be more descriptive than "Menu".</p>
                    <p>Another point I wish to discuss is the filter menu, each competitor lets you filter with dates, but Fever doesn't, we have AirBnB, for exemple, which gives you the possibility to pick a range of date.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the profile section is quite useless, the only reason for you to login is to get access to the wishlist, each one of the competitors that were put under the scope of investigation, had a decent profile section, a place to organize the purchases, to check on the settings, the help, notifications and even messages, I think it would be a great idea to implement a profle section on the website as AirBnB or Viagogo does (let us not reinvent the wheel).</p>
                    <p>Regarding the value proposition, it is very clear and direct, "What to do and see" I think it answers one of the question that people ask themselves on weekends and when they are new in town.</p>
                    <p>Now, I want to share with you my benchmarking which you can see down here:</p>
